    "### Purpose of the Final Swap\n",
    "The final swap ensures that after partitioning a subarray around a chosen pivot, the pivot itself is placed in its correct sorted position within the entire array. This step is crucial because:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Correct Positioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Quicksort works by recursively partitioning the array into smaller subarrays around a pivot, ensuring that elements less than or equal to the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right.\n",
    "After partitioning, the pivot is not yet in its final sorted position relative to the entire array. The final swap ensures it moves to the correct position.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Maintaining Sorted Order:\n",
    "By the time the partition function completes, all elements less than or equal to the pivot are to its left, and all elements greater than the pivot are to its right.\n",
    "However, the pivot itself is still located at the end of the left partition (or the beginning of the right partition depending on implementation), not in between the two partitions where it should be to maintain sorted order.\n",
    "Completion of Partitioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final swap effectively places the pivot in its correct sorted position relative to the entire subarray being processed by the quicksort algorithm.\n",
    "This allows the subsequent recursive calls to correctly sort the left and right partitions of the array.\n",
    "Example Walkthrough\n",
    "Let's illustrate this with an example using the array [4, 1, 3, 9, 7] and choosing 7 as the pivot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Array: [4, 1, 3, 9, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "##### After Partitioning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning around 7 results in [4, 1, 3] (left of 7) and [9, 7] (right of 7).\n",
    "At this point, the array might look like [4, 1, 3, 7, 9] but 7 is not yet in its final sorted position.\n",
    "Final Swap:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final swap array[i + 1], array[high] = array[high], array[i + 1] ensures that 7 is moved to its correct sorted position, which is between the left and right partitions.\n",
    "After the swap, the array becomes [4, 1, 3, 7, 9], with 7 correctly positioned."
