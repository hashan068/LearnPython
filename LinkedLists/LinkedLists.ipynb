    "* The Node class is used to to create four nodes, the nodes are then linked together, and printed at the end.\n",

    "* As you can see, the Python code is a lot shorter than the C code, and perhaps better if you just want to understand the concept of linked lists, and not how linked lists are stored in memory.\n",
